# C03P06 - Conway's Game of Life

It's time. We are going to implement a classic - [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

And this time, we won't have very strict requirements. Actually, we'll have only 3 requirements:

1. Have a Python module, called `game_of_life.py`, which we can run & observe a simulation.
1. Have a test suite, in a separate module, that prooves the core of the game is functional & works as intended.
1. Have a `.gif` or `.mp4` showing the game in action - with a simulation in place.

You can spice things up, but try sticking to those 3 requirements, for the initial implementation.
