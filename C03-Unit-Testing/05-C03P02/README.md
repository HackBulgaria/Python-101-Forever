# C03P02 - Interval extended, tests

Take your solution to `C03P01` and cover with with tests:

1. That exists in a separate file (for example, `interval_tests.py`).
1. That are using the `unittest` module from Python.

The solution should come in 2 forms:

1. The source of the tests.
1. A screenshot where you've ran all the tests & they are passing.
